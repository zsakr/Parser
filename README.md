# Parser
Introduction

In this project, we are interested in the syntactic structure of the P-. The parser analyzes a stream of tokens and lexemes generated by the scanner for possible syntax errors in the source code. Given a grammar for the language, we will be using a parser generator, bison, to produce an LALR parsing table. We will use this tool along with the scanner that we implemented in the last assignment.
P- Syntax

A syntax diagram for a programming language is a graphical representation of the syntactic structure of the language. See the syntax diagram of P-. Terminals, represented by ovals, are the tokens passed by the scanner. Nonterminals, represented by rectangular boxes, appear at the left side of the productions of the grammar of the language.

P- is very much like Pascal with additional features borrowed from C and C++. It is a strongly-typed language and has a set of strict scope rules. In addition to the specified syntax, P- programs may contain comments enclosed by a pair of /* and */.
